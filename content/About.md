## Hi! :wave: I'm <span style="color: #FD8803">Chris</span>, nice to meet you.

I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember.  My parents had an early Memotech MTX computer where I learnt Basic programming of games. I was lucky enough to have access to a computer and the internet in the late 1990s.

My interest in SEO started when my parents craft website struggled to rank in Google around 2011. I started to read up on SEO in my spare time while training as a journalist and realised that SEO was something I was truly passionate about.

I attended my first Brighton SEO in 2014 and was amazed at the close knit nature of the SEO community, even in those fairly early days.

I am now working at Ahrefs.com after working for around 10 years agency side.
