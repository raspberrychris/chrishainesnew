Squarespace is a popular all-in-one website building and hosting platform that makes it easy for anyone to create a professional looking website without needing to know how to code. With its drag-and-drop editor, multitude of templates, and built-in ecommerce functionality, Squarespace empowers people to build beautiful websites for their businesses, portfolios, blogs, and more..

However, creating a nice looking website is just the first step. In order for people to actually find and visit your Squarespace site, you need to optimize it for search engines like Google through a process called SEO or Search Engine Optimization. Proper SEO helps your site rank higher in search results so it gets found more easily by your ideal customers and drives more relevant traffic to your site. This ultimately leads to more business and revenue.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll cover all the important things you need to know about optimizing your Squarespace website for better search engine rankings and visibility.

On-Page SEO for Squarespace

On-page SEO refers to optimizing individual web pages on your site. This includes things like your page titles, meta descriptions, headings, content, images, videos, etc. Let’s go over the key on-page elements to optimize in Squarespace.

Page Titles

The page title is displayed as the clickable headline for your page in search results. It’s critical to have keyword-rich titles that accurately describe each page’s content.

In Squarespace, you can edit page titles by going to Pages > select a page > SEO - there’s a field to enter your SEO page title. Keep titles under 60 characters, and focus on important keywords you want the page to rank for.

Meta Descriptions

The meta description is the preview text shown under each search result. Though not directly used for rankings, compelling meta descriptions can improve click-through rates.

To add meta descriptions in Squarespace, go to Pages > select a page > SEO. There's a field to enter your custom meta description for each page. Keep them around 160 characters.

Headings (H1, H2, H3)

Headings help indicate the structure and hierarchy of your content. Proper headings use keywords in the right places.

In the Squarespace page editor, you can designate headings using the Style and Format panels on the right. Make sure to use H1 and H2 tags appropriately to highlight important content.

Content Optimization

Optimizing your actual page content is crucial for SEO. Your content should use keywords naturally and provide value to users. The key things to focus on are:

Incorporating target keywords in headings, opening paragraphs, image captions, alt text, bolded text, and links. Don't over-stuff!

Creating long-form, in-depth content. Squarespace has no limits on word counts.

Having a clear topic focus and structure. Use sections and bullets to organize content.

Including media like images, videos, and graphics to engage visitors.

Publishing new content frequently. Fresh, unique content helps with rankings.

Image Optimization

Images should have short, descriptive filenames containing keywords, such as "keyword-image.jpg". Avoid generic names like "image.jpg".

In Squarespace, go to Images > select image > Details & SEO to edit the image filename.

You should also fill out the Image Description field with a relevant caption for your image. This helps with accessibility and SEO.

For the Image Title field, add keyword-rich text to be shown when hovering over the image.

Squarespace automatically generates alt text for images. But for better SEO, you can manually enter descriptive alt text by editing images in the page editor.

Internal Linking

Linking between related pages on your Squarespace site helps search engines crawl and understand your structure better. To add internal links:

Link mentions of important keywords to relevant pages on your site.

Link images, buttons, and call-to-action copy to relevant content pages.

Include links within your body text to break up large blocks of text.

Create navigation menus linking to important pages.

Interlink related blog posts if you have a Squarespace blog.

URL Structures

Squarespace allows you to customize your page URLs for better SEO.

Under Pages > select a page > Settings > Address, you can set a custom URL slug for each page. Include important keywords in slugs.

You can also set blog post URLs to include the post title by enabling the option under Settings > Blogging.

For products/categories, customize the URL format under Ecommerce > Settings > Products.

Site Speed Optimization

Site speed impacts SEO, user experience, and conversion rates. Follow these tips to speed up your Squarespace site:

Compress large images properly before uploading.

Enable Lazy Loading for images/videos so they load as visitors scroll.

Minimize plugins as they can slow down sites.

Check Page Speed Insights and optimize pages that are slow.

Consider upgrading to a higher Squarespace plan if you need more resources.

Sitemaps

XML sitemaps help search engines discover new and updated content on your site.

Squarespace automatically generates XML sitemaps for your site. Just submit them to Google Search Console once verified.

You can also supplement with custom sitemaps if desired:

Image sitemaps to index all your images
Video sitemaps to index videos
News sitemaps for frequently updated content
Mobile sitemaps
Squarespace allows you to create and manage custom sitemaps.
