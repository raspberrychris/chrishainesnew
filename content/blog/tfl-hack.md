This is a true story about how I stumbled upon an interesting example of a website completely by mistake that I believed had become compromised.

Although you can stumble upon websites that are compromised, they generally aren't government websites, so I was quite interested to take a look at this site within Ahrefs to see what was going on.

The site in question is tfl.gov.uk. This is a website for Transport for London, which runs the underground service in London, UK.

I alerted TFL to the issue last week, and they took the offending website down almost a week later. (So my guess isâ€”it was compromised.)

Before it was taken down, I decided to make a quick video on the topic to show you what has happened. 

I am not exactly sure why the site was created, but it is interesting to see that a government website can be hijacked in such a public way and used to help rank other content and sites.

**You can check out the video below.**

Let me know what you think happened or if you have done any more research into it.
