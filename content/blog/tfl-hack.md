This is a true story about how I found an interesting example of a website that I believed had become compromised, it happened to be a .**gov.uk** website.

The site in question is tfl.org.uk.

I did the right thing and alerted TFL to the issue, they took the offending website down yesterday.

Before it was taken down though, I decided to make a quick video on the topic to show you what has happened.

I am not exactly sure why the site was created, but it is interesting to see that a government website can be hijacked in such a public way and used to help rank other content and sites.
