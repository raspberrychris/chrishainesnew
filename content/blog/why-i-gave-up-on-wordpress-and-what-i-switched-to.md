Hello, my name is Chris. I was a longstanding WordPress user from 2009 to 2020. But now I have largely given up using WordPress at least on my own sites. 

Why?

Well, it's simple. I found something that performed better and was free to host.  Sounds crazy? Hear me out.

SEOs generally obsess over getting site speed and Core Web Vitals to the 100/100 score, to be honest, I am no different and enjoy 

During 2020 I started testing other platforms and discovered that out-of-the-box static sites perform way better. 

Another advantage is that you can host them for free on Github. 

I am a Hugo user. 

What the hell is that, I hear you say.

Well it's what this site is built on.
