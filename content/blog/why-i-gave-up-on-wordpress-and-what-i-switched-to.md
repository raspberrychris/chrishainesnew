Hello, my name is Chris. I was a longstanding WordPress user from 2009 to 2020. But now I have largely given up using WordPress at least on my own sites.

Why?

Well, it's simple. I found something that performed better and was free to host.  Sounds crazy? Hear me out.

SEOs generally obsess over getting site speed and Core Web Vitals to the 100/100 score, to be honest, I am no different and enjoy

During 2020 I started testing other platforms and discovered that out-of-the-box static sites perform way better.

Another advantage is that you can host them for free on Github.

I am a Hugo user.

What the hell is that, I hear you say.

Well it's what this site is built on.

## Why I hate Wordpress now

* You can get great performance from a WordPress site but typically it takes a lot of effort and knowledge or money to get the right plugins.
* Plugins - Unless you can code you will need a lot of plugins for everything. This bloats the CMS and can cause issues.
* Ever had your WordPress account hacked by pesky Russians? I have—-I used to use a plugin called Wordfence to stop that happening again, but again adding more plugins slows everything down.
* SEO plugins—Yoast, Rankmath? They are both great, but sometimes Yoast can mess up like this.
