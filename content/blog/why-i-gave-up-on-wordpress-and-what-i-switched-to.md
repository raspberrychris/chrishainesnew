Hello, my name is Chris. 

I was a WordPress user from \~2009 to 2020. 

But now, I have largely given up using WordPress on my own sites.

Why?

Well, the page speed scores sucked. 

The site speed sucked. 

In fact, almost everything about WordPress...sucked.

I'll admit that much of my WordPress bad experience was self-inflicted. I wanted to install ALL the things.

I installed too many plugins.

And when it came to writing, I hated using the HTML editor. 

Even if you wanted to use the "classic editor", you had to install another bloody plugin. 

Jesus.

These are just a few of my grievances with WordPress.

Fast forward to today. 

I'm proud to say that I have been WordPress-free for almost two years.

So what did I switch to?

Hugo.

What the hell is that, I hear you say.

My response: Google it.

But if you want to get decent performance scores like this then you too can ditch WordPress and join the revolution.

Ok, anyway, we are getting sidetracked. 

Let's get back to why I hate WordPress in a little bit more detail.

## Why I hate WordPress 

* You _can_ get great performance from a WordPress site, but typically it takes a lot of effort and knowledge, or money to get the right plugins.
* Plugins - Unless you can code, you will need a lot of plugins for everything. This bloats the CMS and can cause issues.
* Ever had your WordPress account hacked? I have—-I used to use a plugin called Wordfence to stop that from happening, but again adding more plugins slows everything down.
* SEO plugins—Yoast, Rankmath? They are both great, but sometimes Yoast can mess up like **this**.  
* Want to get great Core Web Vitals scores—me too. That's what Google wants us to do right? again it takes effort with WordPress and even if you find a template you like, it may not be SEO optimized.
* Installed a bad plugin by mistake? Oh whoops your site is now down, and you will have to jump into the host to fix it.
