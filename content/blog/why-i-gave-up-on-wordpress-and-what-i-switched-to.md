Hello, my name is Chris. 

I was a WordPress user from \~2009 to 2020. 

But now, I have largely given up using WordPress on my own sites.

Why?

Well, the page speed scores sucked. 

The site speed sucked. 

In fact, almost everything about WordPress...sucked.

I installed too many plugins, and I hated writing in the HTML editor. 

Even if you wanted to use the "classic editor", you had to install another bloody plugin.

These are just a few of my grievances with WordPress.

Fast forward to today. I've now been WordPress-free for almost two years.

Things are good—check this out.

So what did I switch to?

I switched to Hugo. If you have a simple blog I don't think there are many things that can beat it.

Ok anyway, we are getting sidetracked. Let's get back to why I hate WordPress in more detail.

## Why I hate WordPress 

* You _can_ get great performance from a WordPress site, but typically it takes a lot of effort and knowledge, or money to get the right plugins.
* Plugins - Unless you can code, you will need a lot of plugins for everything. This bloats the CMS and can cause issues.
* Ever had your WordPress account hacked? I have—-I used to use a plugin called Wordfence to stop that from happening, but again adding more plugins slows everything down.
* SEO plugins—Yoast, Rankmath? They are both great, but sometimes Yoast can mess up like **this**.  
* Want to get great Core Web Vitals scores—me too. That's what Google wants us to do right? again it takes effort with WordPress and even if you find a template you like, it may not be SEO optimized.
