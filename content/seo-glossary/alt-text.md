## What is it?

Alt Text (Alternative Text)

Alt text, also known as alternative text, is a textual description of a non-textual element, such as an image, audio file, or video, that is included in a web page or other digital content. It is designed to provide a textual alternative for users who cannot access or have difficulty accessing the non-textual element, such as users with visual impairments or those who use assistive technologies like screen readers.

The purpose of alt text is to ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can understand and interact with the content on a website or other digital platform. It helps create a more inclusive and accessible digital experience for everyone.

  <path d="M50 10 L30 30 L40 30 L20 50 L30 50 L10 70 L50 30 L70 70 L50 50 L60 50 L40 30 L50 30 Z" fill="green" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" alt="A bar chart showing the percentage of people who prefer different types of pizza, with a green bar for pepperoni, a red bar for cheese, and a yellow bar for vegetarian." />
