2. Link farms: Creating a network of websites that all link to each other to artificially inflate a website's link popularity and ranking.

3. Cloaking: Presenting different content to search engine crawlers and users, usually by delivering text-heavy content to the crawlers and media-rich content to the users.

4. Doorway pages: Creating low-quality web pages that are optimized for specific keywords and designed to rank well in search engine results, only to redirect users to a different page once they click on the result.

5. Spamming: Posting numerous low-quality comments, forum posts, or social media updates with links to a website, often with the same or similar anchor text, to artificially increase a website's link popularity and ranking.

6. Negative SEO: Attempting to harm a competitor's website ranking by using Black Hat SEO techniques on their website, such as linking to their site from a link farm or creating doorway pages with their URL.

7. Hacking: Gaining unauthorized access to a website to manipulate its content or settings, such as adding invisible text or links, to improve its search engine ranking.

8. Duplicate content: Copying content from another website and using it on your own to save time and effort, without adding any value or changes. This can result in your website being penalized for having duplicate content.

9. Rich snippet spam: Manipulating structured data markup to improve a website's visibility in search engine results, such as adding fake reviews or testimonials.

10. Mobile app spam: Creating low-quality mobile apps that are optimized for specific keywords and designed to rank well in app store search results, only to provide a poor user experience or promote other products and services once installed.
