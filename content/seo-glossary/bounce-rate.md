## What is it?

Bounce Rate: A metric used in web analytics to describe the percentage of visitors who enter a website and then leave without taking any further action or visiting any other pages within the same session. It is an indicator of how well a website is engaging its audience and can help identify areas for improvement in terms of user experience, content, and design. A high bounce rate may suggest that a website is not providing relevant or engaging content, has poor navigation, or is not targeting the correct audience. Conversely, a low bounce rate may indicate that a website is providing valuable content and a positive user experience, leading to more engaged visitors and potential conversions.
