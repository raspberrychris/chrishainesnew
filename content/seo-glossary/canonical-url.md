## What is it?

Canonical URL: A canonical URL, also known as a "preferred" or "recommended" URL, is a unique and consistent identifier for a web page or other digital content. It is a way to standardize the way a resource is identified, making it easier for search engines and other systems to understand and index the content. Canonical URLs help prevent duplicate content issues and improve the overall quality of search engine results.

## Here are some examples:

1. On a website's homepage: The canonical URL for a website's homepage is typically the domain name (e.g., `https://example.com/`). This tells search engines that the homepage is the most important page on the website and should be prioritized in search results.

2. On a blog post: The canonical URL for a blog post is the unique address of that post on the blog (e.g., `https://example.com/blog/post-title`). This helps search engines understand the structure of the blog and prioritize the most recent or popular posts in search results.

3. On a product page: The canonical URL for a product page is the unique address of that product on the e-commerce website (e.g., `https://example.com/products/product-name`). This allows search engines to easily identify and index the product, making it easier for users to find when searching for similar products.

4. On a category page: The canonical URL for a category page is the unique address of that category on the website (e.g., `https://example.com/categories/clothing`). This helps search engines understand the structure of the website and prioritize the most relevant categories in search results.

5. On a user profile: The canonical URL for a user profile is the unique address of that user on the platform (e.g., `https://example.com/users/username`). This allows search engines to easily identify and index the user, making it easier for users to find when searching for similar profiles.

6. On a news article: The canonical URL for a news article is the unique address of that article on the news website (e.g., `https://example.com/news/article-title`). This helps search engines understand the structure of the news website and prioritize the most recent or popular articles in search results.

7. On a video: The canonical URL for a video is the unique address of that video on the platform (e.g., `https://example.com/videos/video-title`). This allows search engines to easily identify and index the video, making it easier for users to find when searching for similar content.

8. On an image: The canonical URL for an image is the unique address of that image on the website or platform (e.g., `https://example.com/images/image-name`). This allows search engines to easily identify and index the image, making it easier for users to find when searching for similar images.

9. On a PDF or other document: The canonical URL for a PDF or other document is the unique address of that document on the website or platform (e.g., `https://example.com/documents/document-name`). This allows search engines to easily identify and index the document, making it easier for users to find when searching for similar content.

10. On a mobile app: The canonical URL for a mobile app is the unique address of that app on the app store (e.g., `https://example.com/apps/app-name`). This allows search engines to easily identify and index the app, making it easier for users to find when searching for similar apps.

## In Summary

The Canonical URL is a web address that represents a unique and unambiguous location of a web page or other digital resource. It is a standardized and structured way of identifying and referencing resources on the internet, making it easier for search engines and other systems to understand and organize the vast amount of information available online. The Canonical URL helps prevent duplicate content issues, improves search engine rankings, and ensures that users are directed to the most relevant and up-to-date version of a resource.
