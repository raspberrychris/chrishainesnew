It encompasses the entirety of a customer's experience, from the initial awareness stage to the post-purchase stage, and includes all the touchpoints and channels through which a customer interacts with the brand. The customer journey is a critical concept in customer experience management, as it helps businesses identify and map the various stages of a customer's relationship with their brand, pinpoint areas for improvement, and ultimately, enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
