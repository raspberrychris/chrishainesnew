## What is it?

A doorway page, also known as a gateway page, is a web page that is designed to rank high on search engine results pages (SERPs) for specific keywords, with the primary goal of driving traffic to another page or website. It is a technique used in search engine optimization (SEO) to increase the visibility of a website and attract more visitors.

Doorway pages are often used when a website wants to target multiple keywords or phrases that are related to each other. Instead of optimizing the main website for all these keywords, a doorway page is created for each keyword. This page is then optimized for the specific keyword, including the use of relevant content, meta tags, and links.

When a user searches for the targeted keyword and lands on the doorway page, they are usually presented with information relevant to their search query. The doorway page may also contain a link to the main website or other relevant pages, encouraging the user to visit these sites and potentially convert into a customer.

In the early days of SEO, doorway pages were a common technique to improve a website's search engine rankings. However, search engines have become more sophisticated and can now identify doorway pages, which may result in penalties or lower rankings for the main website. As a result, doorway pages are not as effective as they once were and should be used with caution.
