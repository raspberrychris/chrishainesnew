## What is it?

Ego bait is a marketing and communication strategy that involves leveraging people's egos to attract their attention, engage them, and ultimately persuade them to take a desired action. This can be achieved by using flattery, praise, or other ego-boosting techniques to make the target audience feel special, important, or superior. Ego bait can be used in various contexts, such as advertising, public relations, and personal interactions, to influence people's perceptions and behaviors.
