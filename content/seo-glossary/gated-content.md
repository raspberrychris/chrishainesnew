## What is it?

Gated Content:

Gated content refers to any digital material or resource that is not freely accessible and requires some form of authentication or payment to be unlocked. It is a common strategy used by content creators, publishers, and marketers to provide exclusive or premium content to their target audience while restricting access to non-subscribers or casual visitors. Gated content can take various forms, such as articles, videos, podcasts, e-books, or any other digital media, and is often used to generate revenue, increase user engagement, or gather valuable user data.

## Here are some examples:

Gated content is used in various places, including:

1. Websites: Many websites use gated content to provide exclusive access to premium content, such as articles, videos, or downloadable resources. Users are required to sign up, subscribe, or pay a fee to access this content.

Example: The New York Times offers gated content through its subscription model, where users need to pay for a subscription to access premium articles and features.

2. Email Marketing: Businesses often use gated content as an incentive to grow their email list. Users are offered valuable content, such as e-books, whitepapers, or webinars, in exchange for providing their email address and subscribing to the company's newsletter.

Example: HubSpot offers a variety of gated content resources, such as e-books and webinars, to help users learn about marketing, sales, and customer support strategies.

3. Social Media: Brands may use gated content on social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Instagram, to provide exclusive access to certain posts or content. Users may need to follow the brand, like a post, or share content to gain access.

Example: A brand may share a post on Facebook that contains a link to a valuable resource, but users need to like the post or share it with their friends to access the content.

4. Online Courses and Training: Many online courses and training programs use gated content to provide access to course materials, such as videos, quizzes, or assignments. Users need to enroll in the course and pay a fee to access this content.

Example: Coursera, an online learning platform, offers a variety of courses from universities and institutions. Users need to enroll in a course and pay a fee to access the course materials and earn a certificate.

5. Membership Sites: Membership sites, such as forums, online communities, or subscription boxes, use gated content to provide exclusive access to members. Users need to sign up and pay a membership fee to access the content and benefits of the site.

Example: Amazon Prime is a membership program that offers gated content, such as free shipping, exclusive deals, and access to Prime Video, a streaming service with original content and movies.
