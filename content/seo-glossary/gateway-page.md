## What is it?

A Gateway Page, also known as a Landing Page, is a web page that serves as an entry point to a website or a section of a website. It is designed to provide visitors with an overview of the site's content, features, and services, and to guide them towards the most relevant or popular areas. Gateway Pages are often used to welcome new users, provide directions, and help users find the information they are looking for quickly and easily. They can also be used to showcase specific products, promotions, or events, and to encourage visitors to take action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter.
