## What is it?

Google Dance refers to a phenomenon observed in Google's search engine results pages (SERPs), where the rankings of websites and other search results seem to fluctuate or "dance" around a specific position. This movement can be observed over a period of time, as the same search query is performed repeatedly. The term was first coined by search engine optimization (SEO) professionals who noticed the fluctuation in search results and likened it to a dance.

The cause of Google Dance is not publicly disclosed by Google, but it is believed to be related to the search engine's algorithm updates, indexing, or ranking factors. Some SEO experts suggest that Google Dance may be a way for the search engine to test new ranking algorithms or to combat search engine spam.

While Google Dance can be frustrating for users and SEO professionals alike, it is important to note that the fluctuations in search results are usually temporary. Over time, the search results will typically stabilize, and a website's ranking will return to its previous position or a new, more accurate position based on the search engine's updated algorithm.
