## What is it?

Google My Business (GMB) is a free and essential tool for businesses and organizations to manage their online presence across Google platforms, including Search, Maps, and Google+. It helps users create and update their business profiles, providing customers with relevant and accurate information about their products and services. GMB offers a wide range of features, such as adding photos, posting updates, and responding to reviews, enabling businesses to engage with their customers and improve their online visibility. By claiming and optimizing their Google My Business listings, businesses can increase their chances of being discovered by potential customers and ultimately drive more traffic and sales to their websites or physical locations.

Google My Business (GMB) is used in various places and for multiple purposes. Here are some examples:

1. Local search results: When people search for a local business or service on Google, the search engine displays a map with markers for nearby businesses. These markers are generated from the information provided in Google My Business listings.

2. Google Maps: When users open Google Maps and search for a local business or service, they can view the business's information, such as its name, address, phone number, and website, which is pulled from the Google My Business listing.

9. Customer reviews: Google My Business allows customers to leave reviews for businesses, which can help improve the business's online reputation and attract new customers.
