## What is it?

Google Penalty: A Google penalty is a negative impact on a website's search engine rankings, traffic, and visibility due to violations of Google's search engine optimization (SEO) guidelines or algorithm updates. Penalties can be manual, meaning they are applied by human reviewers at Google, or algorithmic, meaning they are automatically applied by Google's algorithms. Manual penalties are usually the result of intentional or unintentional black hat SEO practices, while algorithmic penalties can occur due to changes in Google's ranking factors or the website's performance. The consequences of a Google penalty can include lower search engine rankings, reduced organic traffic, and potential loss of revenue or brand visibility.
