The guidelines also provide information on how to remove or disavow harmful backlinks.

5. Site security: Google prioritizes websites that are secure and free from malware, and the guidelines provide instructions on how to protect a website from potential security threats. This includes using SSL certificates, regularly updating software, and monitoring for potential security vulnerabilities.

6. Use of Google tools: The guidelines recommend using various Google tools, such as Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager, to help webmasters better understand their website's performance and make data-driven decisions to improve it.

7. Communication with Google: The guidelines encourage webmasters to engage with Google and share their thoughts and concerns through various channels, such as the Google Webmaster Central Help Forum, the Google+ Webmasters community, or by participating in local events and conferences.
