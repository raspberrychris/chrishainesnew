## What is it?

Guestographic

A guestographic is a visual representation of the distribution and concentration of guests in a hotel, resort, or other hospitality establishment. It is a powerful tool used by hotel managers and marketers to understand the demographics, preferences, and behavior of their guests, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to improve their services and increase customer satisfaction.

Guestographics can be created using various data sources, such as hotel booking systems, guest surveys, and social media platforms. The information gathered can include guest age, gender, nationality, length of stay, room type preference, and other relevant details. This data is then visualized in the form of charts, graphs, or heat maps, allowing hotel management to quickly identify trends and patterns in their guest population.

By analyzing guestographics, hoteliers can gain valuable insights into their customer base, such as:

1. The most popular room types and amenities among different guest segments.
2. The busiest periods and least occupied times of the year.
3. The average length of stay for various guest types.
4. The most popular sources of booking and distribution channels.
5. The most effective marketing strategies and promotions for different guest segments.

This information can help hotel management optimize their operations, marketing efforts, and guest services, ultimately leading to increased revenue and customer loyalty.

Guestographic is a marketing strategy that involves inviting guests or influencers to create content for a brand's social media channels, blog, or other online platforms. This approach helps brands expand their reach, credibility, and engagement by leveraging the guest's audience and expertise. Here are some examples of where Guestographic is used:

1. Instagram: Brands can invite influencers or guests to take over their Instagram account for a day or a week, during which the guest shares their own content related to the brand's niche or industry. This helps the brand reach a new audience and showcase a different perspective on their products or services.
