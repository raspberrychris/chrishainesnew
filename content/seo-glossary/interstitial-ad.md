## What is it?

Interstitial Ad: A form of online advertising that appears between two content pages, typically when a user navigates from one page to another. These ads are designed to grab the user's attention and promote a product, service, or message. They can be in various formats, such as images, videos, or interactive content, and are often used to target specific audiences based on their browsing history and preferences.

## Here are some examples:

Interstitial ads are used in various places, including:

1. Websites: Interstitial ads can be placed on websites, usually between two content pages. When a user navigates from one page to another, the interstitial ad will appear, covering the entire screen or a large portion of it.

Example: When browsing a news website, an interstitial ad might appear between two articles, promoting a new product or service.

2. Mobile apps: Interstitial ads are commonly used in mobile apps, especially in gaming and entertainment apps. They can be placed between levels, chapters, or sections of the app, and users must view the ad before they can continue using the app.

Example: In a mobile game, an interstitial ad might appear after a user completes a level, promoting an in-app purchase or a related game.

3. Video streaming platforms: Interstitial ads can be used in video streaming platforms, such as YouTube, Hulu, and Twitch. They are usually placed before, during, or after a video, and users must watch the ad before they can continue watching the video.

Example: Before a YouTube video starts playing, an interstitial ad might appear, promoting a new movie or TV show.

4. Audio streaming platforms: Interstitial ads can also be used in audio streaming platforms, such as Spotify and Pandora. They are usually placed between songs or podcast episodes, and users must listen to the ad before they can continue listening to the content.

Example: Between two songs on Spotify, an interstitial ad might play, promoting a new album or artist.

5. E-commerce platforms: Interstitial ads can be used on e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and eBay. They can be placed between product listings or search results, and users must view the ad before they can continue browsing products.

Example: After searching for a product on Amazon, an interstitial ad might appear, promoting a related product or a special offer.

6. Social media platforms: Interstitial ads can be used on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. They are usually placed between posts or stories, and users must view the ad before they can continue scrolling through their feed.

Example: While browsing your Instagram feed, an interstitial ad might appear, promoting a new clothing line or beauty product.
