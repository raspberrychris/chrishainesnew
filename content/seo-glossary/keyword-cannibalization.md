title: Keyword Cannibalization
---



## What is it?

Keyword cannibalization refers to a phenomenon in search engine optimization (SEO) where multiple pages or posts within a website compete with each other for the same keyword or phrase. This can occur when a website has several pages that discuss similar topics or use the same keywords, making it difficult for search engines to determine which page is most relevant to a user's query.

Cannibalization can negatively impact a website's search engine rankings, as it can confuse search engines and result in lower organic traffic. To avoid keyword cannibalization, it is essential to use unique and specific keywords for each page, ensure that content is organized and structured effectively, and use internal linking to guide users and search engines to the most relevant content.

## Here are some examples:

Keyword cannibalization occurs when two or more pages on a website are optimized for the same keyword, leading to internal competition and a decrease in organic search traffic. Here are some examples:

1. Homepage and product page: A website's homepage and a product page can both be optimized for the same keyword, such as "wireless headphones." This can lead to the homepage outranking the product page, making it more difficult for users to find the specific product they're looking for.

2. Blog post and product page: A blog post and a product page can both target the same keyword, such as "best wireless headphones." This can result in the blog post outranking the product page, making it harder for users to find the product they want to purchase.

3. Category page and product page: A category page and a product page can both be optimized for the same keyword, such as "wireless headphones." This can lead to the category page outranking the product page, making it more challenging for users to find the specific product they're looking for.

4. Location pages: A website with multiple locations can create separate pages for each location, all targeting the same keyword, such as "wireless headphones store near me." This can result in internal competition, with one location's page outranking another.

5. Temporal pages: A website can create separate pages for different time periods, such as "wireless headphones Black Friday deals" and "wireless headphones Cyber Monday deals." These pages can both target the same keyword, leading to internal competition.

6. Listicle pages: A website can create multiple listicle pages targeting the same keyword, such as "top 10 wireless headphones" and "best wireless headphones under $100." These pages can compete with each other for the same keyword.

7. FAQ pages: A website can create an FAQ page targeting a specific keyword, such as "wireless headphones FAQ." However, other pages on the website may also target the same keyword, leading to internal competition.

8. Social media profiles: A company can create multiple social media profiles on the same platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These profiles can all target the same keyword, leading to internal competition and a decrease in organic search traffic.

9. Webinar and blog post: A website can host a webinar and create a blog post about the same topic, both targeting the same keyword, such as "wireless headphones webinar." This can result in the blog post outranking the webinar page, making it harder for users to find the webinar they want to attend.

10. Press release and blog post: A website can publish a press release and a blog post about the same news, both targeting the same keyword, such as "wireless headphones launch." This can lead to the blog post outranking the press release, making it more challenging for users to find the official news.

## In Summary

Keyword cannibalization occurs when multiple pages or posts on a website target the same keyword, resulting in internal competition and a decrease in organic search traffic. This can happen when a website has duplicate content, thin content, or when the same keyword is used in different contexts. To avoid keyword cannibalization, it is essential to conduct thorough keyword research, create unique and high-quality content, and use relevant internal links to direct users to the most appropriate page.
