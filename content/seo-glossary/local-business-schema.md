## What is it?

Local Business Schema refers to a structured data format used by search engines to understand and classify information about local businesses. It is a type of schema markup that helps search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo! better understand the content and context of a website, making it easier for users to find relevant local businesses and their information.

The Local Business Schema consists of a set of properties and types that describe various aspects of a local business, such as its name, address, phone number, website, hours of operation, and more. By using this schema, businesses can provide search engines with a more detailed and accurate description of their operations, which can improve their online visibility and attract more customers.

Some common properties and types included in the Local Business Schema are:

1. Name: The name of the local business.
2. Address: The street address, city, state, and zip code of the business's physical location.
3. PhoneNumber: The business's phone number, including the area code and local number.
4. Website: The URL of the business's website.
5. HoursOfOperation: The days and times the business is open, including any special hours or closures.
6. PriceRange: The price range of the products or services offered by the business.
7. Rating: The average rating of the business based on customer reviews.
8. Reviews: A list of customer reviews and their respective ratings.
9. Photos: Images of the business, its products, or services.
10. GeoCoordinates: The geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the business's physical location.

By adding Local Business Schema markup to a website, businesses can improve their local search engine optimization (SEO) and make it easier for potential customers to find them online. This can lead to increased foot traffic, phone calls, and website visits, ultimately helping businesses grow and succeed in their local market.
