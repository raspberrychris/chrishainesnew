## What is it?

Local citation refers to the process of mentioning a local business or organization in a piece of content, such as an article, blog post, or social media update. It is an essential aspect of local search engine optimization (SEO) and helps improve the online visibility of local businesses. Local citations typically include the business name, address, and phone number (NAP) and can also feature additional information such as hours of operation, descriptions, and images. They are often found in online directories, review platforms, and social media profiles. The more local citations a business has, the higher its chances of ranking well in local search results and attracting potential customers.

## Here are some examples:

1. On a website's "Contact Us" page, where the business's address, phone number, and email address are listed.

2. In a blog post or article that mentions a local business or event, where the author includes the business's name, address, and phone number.

3. On a social media platform, where a user shares a photo or post about a local business and tags the business's location.

4. In a local directory or listing website, where businesses are organized by category and include their contact information.

5. On a mobile app, where users can search for local businesses and view their contact information and location on a map.

6. In a print publication, such as a newspaper, magazine, or brochure, where local businesses are advertised with their contact information.

7. On a local event website or calendar, where events are listed with their location, date, and time, and often include a link to the event organizer's website or contact information.

8. In a government website or database, where local businesses are registered and their contact information is publicly available.

9. On a job posting website, where local businesses post job openings and include their contact information for applicants.

10. In a review website or platform, where users can leave reviews for local businesses and the business's contact information is displayed alongside the reviews.
