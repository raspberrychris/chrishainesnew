## What is it?

Meta keywords, also known as meta tags or meta data, are a set of keywords or phrases that describe the content of a web page. They are used by search engines to understand the topic and relevance of a page, and to improve the visibility of the page in search engine results. Meta keywords are placed in the HTML code of a web page, within the <meta> tag, and are used in conjunction with other meta tags, such as the title tag and the description tag, to provide a clear and concise summary of the page's content. The use of meta keywords has decreased in importance in recent years, as search engines have become more sophisticated and rely on a wider range of factors to determine the relevance of a page. However, they still play a role in improving the overall SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of a website and should be used judiciously to accurately describe the content of a page.

## Here are some examples:

Meta keywords are used in the HTML code of a website to provide search engines with information about the content of a page. Here are some examples of where meta keywords are used:

1. In the opening tag of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Page</title>
    <meta name="keywords" content="example, page, keywords">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Example Page</h1>
    <p>This is an example page with meta keywords.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

2. In a WordPress website's SEO settings:

```
WP Admin Dashboard > Settings > SEO > Meta Keywords
```

3. In a Shopify website's SEO settings:

```
Shopify Admin Dashboard > Settings > SEO > Meta Keywords
```

4. In a Wix website's SEO settings:

```
Wix Editor > Settings > SEO > Meta Keywords
```

5. In a Weebly website's SEO settings:

```
Weebly Editor > Settings > SEO > Meta Keywords
```

6. In a Joomla website's SEO settings:

```
Joomla Admin Dashboard > Global Configuration > SEO > Meta Keywords
```

7. In a Drupal website's SEO settings:

```
Drupal Admin Dashboard > Configuration > SEO > Meta Keywords
```

Remember that meta keywords are not a significant ranking factor for search engines like Google. It's essential to focus on creating high-quality, relevant content and using appropriate HTML tags to structure your website.

## In Summary
