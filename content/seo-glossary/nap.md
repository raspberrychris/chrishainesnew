## What is it?

Nap: A nap is a short period of sleep, usually lasting between 10 and 30 minutes, taken during the day to restore energy and alertness. It is a common practice in many cultures and has been shown to have various benefits, including improved cognitive function, reduced stress, and increased productivity. The ideal time for a nap is typically between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM, when the body's natural circadian rhythm experiences a dip in energy levels. However, individual factors such as age, health, and personal preference can also play a role in determining the best time and duration for a nap.
