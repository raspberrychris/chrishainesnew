## What is it?

Noopener

A Noopener is a web browser feature that prevents a new window or tab from being opened when a user clicks on a link. This feature is often used to improve user experience by preventing accidental window openings and keeping the user focused on the current page. Noopener can be enabled or disabled through the browser's settings or by using HTML attributes in the web page's code.

## Here are some examples:

(Noopener) is used in the context of HTML links to prevent the opening of a new window or tab when the link is clicked. This is often used for internal links within a website to ensure that the user remains on the same page or window. Here are some examples of where (Noopener) is used:

1. In the following example, the (Noopener) attribute is added to the `a` tag to prevent a new window from opening when the link is clicked:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit Example.com</a>
```

2. In this example, the (Noopener) attribute is used along with the `target` attribute to open a link in a new tab without a new window:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit Example.com in a new tab</a>
```

3. Here, the (Noopener) attribute is used to prevent a new window from opening when a link is clicked, while the `target` attribute is used to open the link in a specific position within the same window:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_top" rel="noopener">Visit Example.com at the top of the page</a>
```

4. In this example, the (Noopener) attribute is used to prevent a new window from opening when a link is clicked, while the `target` attribute is used to open the link in a specific frame within the same window:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_parent" rel="noopener">Visit Example.com in the parent frame</a>
```

5. Here, the (Noopener) attribute is used to prevent a new window from opening when a link is clicked, while the `target` attribute is used to open the link in a specific named frame within the same window:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit Example.com in a named frame</a>
```

## In Summary

Noopener is a web browser extension that prevents websites from opening new windows or tabs without the user's explicit permission. It is designed to improve user experience by eliminating unexpected or unwanted page openings, while still allowing users to open new windows or tabs when they choose to do so. The extension works by intercepting the browser's normal behavior when a link or button is clicked, and instead of opening a new window or tab, it simply navigates to the desired URL in the current window or tab. This way, users can browse the web without fear of accidentally opening multiple windows or tabs, and can focus on their browsing experience without distractions.
