## What is it?

Rich Snippets are enhanced search engine result page (SERP) listings that provide users with more detailed information about the search query. They are designed to help users understand the content of a webpage better and make it easier for them to find the information they are looking for. Rich Snippets can include additional text, images, or other media that provides a more comprehensive overview of the webpage's content. This feature is particularly useful for search queries related to products, recipes, events, or other content that requires a more in-depth description.
