## What is it?

Schema Markup, also known as structured data, is a code-based organization of information on a website that helps search engines and other platforms understand and interpret the content more accurately. It is a standardized format that allows developers to embed structured data within a website's HTML, making it easier for search engines to recognize and display the information in a more organized and informative manner. Schema Markup is commonly used to improve the visibility and functionality of a website in search engine results pages (SERPs) and other platforms that make use of structured data.

## Here are some examples:

Schema markup, also known as structured data, is used to help search engines understand the content of a webpage better. It is a code (usually in JSON-LD format) that is added to the HTML of a webpage to provide additional information about the page's content.

Here are some examples of where schema markup is used:

1. Local businesses: Schema markup can be used to provide information about a local business, such as its name, address, phone number, and opening hours. This helps search engines display more accurate and informative results when users search for local businesses.

2. Events: Schema markup can be used to provide information about events, such as their name, date, time, and location. This helps search engines display more accurate and informative results when users search for events.

3. Recipes: Schema markup can be used to provide information about recipes, such as their name, ingredients, and cooking instructions. This helps search engines display more accurate and informative results when users search for recipes.

4. Movies: Schema markup can be used to provide information about movies, such as their title, director, and release date. This helps search engines display more accurate and informative results when users search for movies.
