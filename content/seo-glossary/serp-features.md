3. Featured snippets: These are the highlighted search results that appear at the top of the SERP, providing a direct answer to the user's query. They are extracted from the organic search results and are not paid placements.

4. Knowledge panels: These are the information boxes that appear on the right side of the SERP, providing quick access to relevant information about a person, place, or thing.
