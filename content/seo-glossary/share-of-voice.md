## What is it?

Share of Voice (SOV) is a marketing metric that measures the percentage of time a brand or product is mentioned or seen in a given market or industry. It is a useful indicator of a brand's visibility, presence, and market share, and is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and strategies. SOV can be calculated by dividing the total number of mentions or impressions of a brand by the total number of mentions or impressions of all brands in the same market, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. A high Share of Voice indicates a strong brand presence and a larger portion of the market's attention, while a low Share of Voice may signal the need for a more aggressive marketing approach.
