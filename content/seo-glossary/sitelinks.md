## What is it?

Sitelinks, also known as website links, are the hyperlinks that appear below the main search result of a website in a search engine. These links are generated by the search engine's algorithm and are designed to help users navigate the website more effectively. Sitelinks can include the website's main pages, such as the homepage, contact page, or specific product pages, and are meant to provide a quick and easy way for users to access the most relevant and popular sections of the website. The presence of sitelinks in a search result is an indication of the website's authority and popularity, as search engines only display sitelinks for well-established and high-quality websites.

## Here are some examples:

(1) Google Search: When you search for a keyword or phrase on Google, you may see a search result with a link to a website and several other links below it. These additional links are called Sitelinks, and they help users navigate to different sections of the website more easily.

Example: When you search for "Nike," the first search result is the Nike website, and the Sitelinks below it are "Shop," "News," "Events," and "Contact Us."

(2) Google Maps: When you search for a business or location on Google Maps, you may see a map with a pinpointed location and a link to the business's website. Below the website link, there are usually Sitelinks to the business's hours, directions, and contact information.

Example: When you search for "Starbucks" on Google Maps, the first search result is a map with a pinpointed Starbucks location, and the Sitelinks below it are "Hours," "Directions," and "Contact Us."

(3) Google Shopping: When you search for a product on Google Shopping, you may see a list of search results with images, prices, and links to the product pages. Below the product page link, there are often Sitelinks to the retailer's website, customer reviews, and shipping information.

Example: When you search for "wireless headphones" on Google Shopping, the first search result is a link to a specific headphone model on the retailer's website, and the Sitelinks below it are "Website," "Customer Reviews," and "Shipping Information."

(4) Google Images: When you search for an image on Google Images, you may see a list of search results with images and links to the websites where the images are hosted. Below the website link, there are sometimes Sitelinks to the image's location on the website, the website's homepage, and related images.

Example: When you search for "puppy" on Google Images, the first search result is a link to a specific puppy image on a website, and the Sitelinks below it are "Image Location," "Website," and "Related Images."

(5) Google News: When you search for a topic on Google News, you may see a list of search results with news articles and links to the publications where the articles are published. Below the publication link, there are often Sitelinks to the publication's homepage, related articles, and contact information.

Example: When you search for "climate change" on Google News, the first search result is a link to a specific news article on a publication's website, and the Sitelinks below it are "Publication," "Related Articles," and "Contact Us."

## In Summary

Sitelinks are a feature in Google Search that display additional links below the main search result, providing users with quick access to other relevant pages on the same website. These links are generated automatically by Google's algorithms, which analyze the structure and content of the website to determine the most relevant and useful pages for users. Sitelinks can help users navigate a website more efficiently and can also improve the visibility and user experience of the website in search results.
