## What is it?

Sitewide Link: A sitewide link is a hyperlink that points to a specific page or resource on a website, but is accessible and visible on all other pages of the site. It is a way to provide easy navigation and access to important or frequently visited areas of a website, without cluttering the main navigation menu. Sitewide links are often placed in the footer or sidebar of a website, and they can be either text-based or image-based.

## Here are some examples:

Sitewide Links are used in various places on a website to provide easy navigation and access to important pages or sections. Some examples of where Sitewide Links are used include:

1. In the main menu: The main menu is the most prominent place to include Sitewide Links, as it provides quick access to the most important pages on the website.

2. In the footer: The footer is another common place to include Sitewide Links, as it allows users to easily navigate to important pages without having to scroll back up to the main menu.

3. In the sidebar: If a website has a sidebar, it can be used to display Sitewide Links to important pages or sections.

4. In the header: Some websites may choose to include Sitewide Links in the header section, which provides quick access to important pages for users who land on the homepage.

5. In the content: Depending on the website's design, Sitewide Links can also be included within the content of a page, such as in a blog post or article. This allows users to easily navigate to related content or important pages while reading the content.

6. In the comments section: If a website has a comments section, Sitewide Links can be included to provide quick access to important pages or sections for users who are reading and engaging with the comments.

7. In the search results: When a user performs a search on the website, Sitewide Links can be included in the search results to provide quick access to important pages or sections related to the search query.

8. In the error pages: If a website displays an error page, such as a 404 page, Sitewide Links can be included to provide quick access to important pages or sections for users who land on the error page.
