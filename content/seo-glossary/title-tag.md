## What is it?

Title Tag: A title tag, also known as a page title or website title, is an HTML element that specifies the title of a web page. It is placed within the head section of an HTML document and is used to display the title of the page in a browser's title bar or tab. The title tag is essential for both user experience and search engine optimization (SEO), as it helps users and search engines understand the main topic and purpose of the page.

## Here are some examples:

The <title> tag is used in the head section of an HTML document to specify the title of the document. Here are some examples of where the <title> tag is used:

1. In the head section of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

2. In the head section of an XHTML document:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

3. In the head section of a SVG document:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="svg1" xml:lang="en">
<defs>
    <style>
        .cls1 {
            fill: red;
        }
    </style>
</defs>
<g id="g1">
    <title>Group Title</title>
    <rect class="cls1" x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100" />
    <circle class="cls1" cx="50" cy="50" r="40" />
</g>
</svg>
```

In these examples, the <title> tag is used to specify the title of the document (or group, in the case of the SVG document). The title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, and it can also be used by search engines and other systems to identify the document.
