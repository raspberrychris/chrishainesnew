## In Summary

Top Level Domain (TLD) refers to the highest level of domain names in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. These domains are organized and managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). TLDs are used to identify the type of organization or entity that owns the domain, such as .com for commercial entities, .org for non-profit organizations, and .edu for educational institutions. They also help in organizing the internet's namespace and provide a hierarchical structure for domain names.
