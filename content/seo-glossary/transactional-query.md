## What is it?

Transactional Query:

A transactional query is a type of database query that is designed to handle transactions, which are sets of operations that must be processed in a specific order and must either all succeed or all fail together. These queries are essential for maintaining data consistency and integrity in multi-user environments, as they ensure that only one user can access and modify the data at a time.

In a transactional query, the database management system (DBMS) first checks if the requested operation can be performed without violating any constraints or affecting the integrity of the data. If the operation is deemed safe, the DBMS then performs the operation and updates the relevant data. However, if the operation is deemed unsafe or if there is a conflict with another user's operation, the DBMS will reject the query and roll back any changes that may have been made.

Transactional queries are commonly used in financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and other applications where data consistency and integrity are crucial. They help prevent potential data loss, inconsistencies, and conflicts between users, ensuring that the system remains stable and reliable.

## Here are some examples:

A Transactional Query is used when you need to perform a series of data manipulation operations (such as inserting, updating, or deleting data) in a single, isolated transaction. Here are some examples:

1. Transferring money between two bank accounts: When transferring money from one account to another, you need to ensure that the transaction is processed atomically. This means that both the debit from one account and the credit to another account should be treated as a single transaction. If one operation fails, the other should also fail, and the system should roll back to the previous state.

2. Updating inventory and order status: When processing an order, you need to update the inventory to reflect the items sold and change the order status to "completed." These two operations should be treated as a single transaction to ensure data consistency.

3. Deleting a row and inserting a new row: If you need to replace a row in a table with a new row, you can use a transactional query to delete the old row and insert the new row as a single atomic operation.

4. Updating a primary key: If you need to update the primary key of a table, you can use a transactional query to ensure that the update is processed atomically. This is especially important if the primary key is used as a foreign key in other tables.

5. Executing a stored procedure: Many stored procedures perform a series of data manipulation operations. By using a transactional query, you can ensure that the entire procedure is processed as a single transaction, providing better data consistency and error handling.

In all these examples, using a Transactional Query ensures that the data remains consistent and that any errors are handled properly by rolling back the transaction to the previous state.

## In Summary

Transactional Query is a database management system feature that allows users to perform complex data analysis and reporting tasks without affecting the performance or integrity of the underlying data. It provides a separate, read-only copy of the data for querying, ensuring that the original data remains untouched and secure. This enables users to run ad-hoc queries, generate reports, and analyze data without any impact on the production system.
