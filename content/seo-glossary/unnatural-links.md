## What is it?

Unnatural links, also known as artificial or manipulative links, are links created by webmasters or SEO professionals to increase the ranking of a website on search engine results pages (SERPs). These links are considered unnatural because they are not organically generated by users or other webmasters, but rather, they are intentionally placed to manipulate the website's ranking. Unnatural links can be in the form of purchased links, exchanged links, or self-created links, and they can be either internal or external.

Search engines, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo, use complex algorithms to determine the ranking of websites on their SERPs. One of the key factors in these algorithms is the quality and quantity of links pointing to a website. Natural links, which are organically generated by users or webmasters who find the content valuable, are considered high-quality and contribute positively to a website's ranking. On the other hand, unnatural links, which are created artificially to manipulate the ranking, are considered low-quality and can even lead to penalties or bans from search engines.

To avoid penalties and maintain the integrity of their search results, search engines actively monitor and detect unnatural links. They use various techniques, such as analyzing link patterns, checking the quality of the linking websites, and examining the anchor text used in the links. If a website is found to have a high number of unnatural links, it may be penalized by being demoted in the search results or even removed from the index entirely.

In conclusion, unnatural links are links that are created artificially to manipulate a website's ranking on search engine results pages. They can be in the form of purchased, exchanged, or self-created links and can be either internal or external. Search engines actively monitor and detect unnatural links to maintain the integrity of their search results and penalize websites that use them.

## In Summary

(Unnatural Links) refers to links that are created or manipulated in an unnatural way, usually for the purpose of manipulating search engine rankings. These links can be harmful to a website's reputation and can result in penalties from search engines. Examples of unnatural links include:

1. Links from low-quality or spammy websites: These links can harm a website's reputation and should be removed or disavowed.
2. Paid links: Buying or selling links for the purpose of improving search engine rankings is against search engine guidelines and can result in penalties.
3. Excessive link exchanges: Engaging in too many link exchanges with other websites can be considered an unnatural linking pattern and may lead to penalties.
4. Use of link farms or private blog networks (PBNs): These are groups of websites created solely for the purpose of linking to other websites to improve their search engine rankings. Using these can result in penalties.
5. Hidden or disguised links: Placing links in a way that makes them hard to see or understand by users, such as in tiny text or behind images, can be considered unnatural and may lead to penalties.

To avoid unnatural links, it is essential to focus on creating high-quality, relevant content that attracts natural links from other websites. Additionally, monitoring a website's link profile and disavowing any unnatural links can help protect its reputation and search engine rankings.
