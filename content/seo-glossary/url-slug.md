## What is it?

URL Slug: A URL slug, also known as a permalink, is a user-friendly and search engine optimized web address that represents a specific page or post on a website. It is typically a short and descriptive phrase that helps users and search engines easily identify the content of the page. URL slugs are important for improving a website's usability, accessibility, and overall user experience.

## Here are some examples:

A URL slug is a part of a web page's URL that is used to identify the page and make it easier to remember and share. It is usually a short, descriptive, and human-readable string that comes after the domain name and before the file name or query string. Here are some examples of where a URL slug is used:

1. Blog posts: Many blogging platforms, such as WordPress and Tumblr, use URL slugs to identify individual blog posts. The slug is often generated from the post's title and appears in the URL like this:

```
https://example.com/blog/post-title-here
```

2. Product pages: Online stores and e-commerce platforms use URL slugs to identify product pages. The slug is often generated from the product's name or model number and appears in the URL like this:

```
https://example.com/store/product-name-here
```

3. User profiles: Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Instagram, use URL slugs to identify user profiles. The slug is often generated from the user's name or handle and appears in the URL like this:

```
https://example.com/user/username-here
```

4. Topic pages: Websites that cover multiple topics or categories may use URL slugs to identify specific topic pages. The slug is often generated from the topic's name and appears in the URL like this:

```
https://example.com/topics/topic-name-here
```

5. Search results: Some websites and search engines use URL slugs to identify search results. The slug is often generated from the search query and appears in the URL like this:

```
https://example.com/search?q=search-query-here
```

6. Custom pages: Websites may create custom pages with unique content and use URL slugs to identify these pages. The slug is often generated from the page's title or purpose and appears in the URL like this:

```
https://example.com/custom-page/page-title-here
